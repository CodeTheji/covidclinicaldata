# Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Clinical Data Repository

This is an effort to compile a repository of the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 tested patients. By sharing our schema and data, we hope that we can 1) accelerate information sharing among frontline healthcare providers and 2) facilitate studies on COVID-19 signs, symptoms, stages, and care plans.

## Data

The repository is maintained in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11IuOqJ_L0wYcbDqovmDaASR2aae79I5a9wpGVOuQ9bU/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Sheets</a> and as a [CSV](data/carbonhealth_and_braidhealth/ALL/4.6_carbonhealth_and_braidhealth.csv). Each row represents a COVID-19 tested patient.

New data from our contributors and Carbon Health will be compiled and published, every week on Tuesdays. The list of contributors and supporters is maintained in the section below.

    - Notes: 
        1. We include data from all patients who have taken the SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-PCR test since 3.7.20, across our clinics in California and Nevada. 
        2. Our data includes **clinical characteristics** in addition to **radiological** and **laboratory** findings. Our data does not include **treatment plans**, **complications**, and **clinical outcomes**. 
        3. We include both positive- and negative-tested patient characteristics. As of 4.6.20, these include the characteristics of symptomatic patients, those in professions with a high risk of exposure, and those who may have been exposed through contact with a known infected person. 
        4. The columns for clinician-assessed symptoms are sparse due to some criteria having been added later. 
        5. A patient's reported age differs from their actual age by a reasonable randomized amount to protect their privacy. We remain compliant with [HIPAA Privacy Rule's De-Identification Standard](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html#standard).
